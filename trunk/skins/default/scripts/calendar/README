This is a third-party calendar modul, which you may use with the
Yana PHP-Framework. This version uses a modified CSS-theme and
does not include the manual.
The JS-files are stripped for better performance.
See the source.FOO.js files to review the full source code.

You may get the original version from the author's web site,
including manual, API-documentation and examples.

See www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar for details.
Thanks goes to Mihai Bazon for this great piece of free software.
