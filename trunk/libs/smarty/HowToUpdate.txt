How to update Smarty:

To update Smarty to a later version,
- go to http://smarty.net
- download the latest version
- unpack the archive to this directory

Note that you may remove the demos, as you don't need them to run the engine.

If you are a developer and use an editor with syntax-checking, you may also
want to remove some documentation files, which you don't need.
I usually do so, as some of the contents, esp. PHP-tags in the change-log,
may cause editors - NetBeans in my case - to report syntax-errors inside the
documentation files. These are false-positives, of course.


Note: if you are a developer, you may also want to take a look at the latest
unstable version of Smarty in the SVN repository and join the discussion on
their online-forum.


Personal note:
I would like to express my personal respect for the Smarty development team,
which has done a great job of providing people with (as I believe) the most
popular template engine ever for PHP. Keep up the good work!
