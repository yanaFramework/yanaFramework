    To ease your search this program automatically searches for possibly
    related words as well.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when searching for &quot;new&quot; you will also get sites
    which contain similar phrases like &quot;news&quot;. But you won't get
    soundalikes like &quot;newbies&quot;, that you were probably not searching
    for.

<p>
    Please note, that this feature was intended for German texts and is less
    effective on English websites. Even though it also slightly improves the
    quality of search results for most other languages.
